      recommendation: "Recommended Drink: Prince of Wales"
      text: "Named after the 1970's pornographic film 'Behind the Green Door', this
        Sch√∂neberg institution is a must for any serious cocktail lovers looking for an
        open-minded spot that takes its drinks seriously while maintaining a friendly and relaxed
        atmophere. Where many cocktail bars employ trained robots that churn out expertly crafted
        drinks with no emotion, here they take their time and pride themselves just as much on
        conversations with the guests."
      notes: "Upon arrival, press the button at the door (do not knock) and wait for someone to let
        you in. If you are a party of over 4 people reservations are almost always a must. Shorts and
        talking on mobile phones in the bar are not allowed. For non-smokers who are bothered by
        smoky bars, this is not a recommended spot."
